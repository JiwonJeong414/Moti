Moti is an app designed by students, for students, to help organize their lives and improve their mental health. The app provides tools such as to-do lists, long-term countdowns, habit trackers, motivational quotes, and a mood calendar to boost productivity and mental well-being. Moti also includes quick access to mental health hotlines for those in need.

## Features

- **To-Do Lists**: Manage daily tasks and assignments efficiently.
- **Long-Term Countdowns**: Track big events and goals with countdowns.
- **Habit Trackers**: Build and track habits, with streaks rewarded with encouraging messages.
- **Motivational Quotes**: Access hundreds of quotes to stay inspired and productive.
- **Mood Calendar**: Track emotions over time using animated characters and analyze your mood trends.
- **Emergency Hotlines**: Instantly access mental health hotlines via the phone icon for immediate support.

## Inspiration

We started high school online and noticed how difficult it was to balance school tasks and mental health during the pandemic. Moti was built to answer the question: *What kind of app would we have wanted during our freshman year?* Our mission is to provide students with a tool to stay organized and mentally strong as they navigate school life. The app is continually evolving based on feedback from our peers and teachers.

## Technical Challenges

- **User Data Management**: We struggled with saving user-specific features like profile images and banners but successfully implemented this using Firebase.
- **Swipe-to-Delete**: Implementing the swipe-left function for to-do lists was challenging but resolved by creating a Task component and integrating it with a map.
- **Nickname Bug**: An unmounted error when editing nicknames was fixed by delaying the close modal animation by 700 milliseconds.
- **Complex Navigation**: We simplified the navigation system by dedicating a single file for handling screen transitions.
- **App Publishing**: Overcoming the review stages for the App Store and Google Play was challenging but eventually successful.

## Future Improvements (Version 2.0)

We believe Moti has room to grow, and here are some planned features for the next version:

- **Reminders**: Add scheduled notifications like "Meeting tomorrow at 4:00 PM" to help users remember important tasks.
- **Pomodoro Timer**: A timer feature that sets work and break intervals to improve focus.
- **Animated Badges**: Additional animations and badges to allow users to personalize their experience.
- **Mental Health Alerts**: If users consistently record "sad" moods, the app will suggest motivational content or connect them with therapists for support.

## Our Journey

Moti was developed during the summer before our junior year, driven by the desire to support our community. Through continual updates and improvements, Moti has grown with input from students and teachers, and we remain committed to enhancing the app to help students stay productive and mentally well.
